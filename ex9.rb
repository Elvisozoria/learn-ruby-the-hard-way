# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly

days = "Mom Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

puts <<PARAGRAPH
There's something going on here.
With the PARAGRAPH thing
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
PARAGRAPH


puts %q{
You can also do it this way
    I guess is the new correct way to do it
    The q probably stand fow quote
    anyway I still preder paragraph, i think is more intuitive.

    It even takes the spacing and everything

    And as it is inside brakets it dows not need indentation, if you do indent it it will show on the output as well
}
